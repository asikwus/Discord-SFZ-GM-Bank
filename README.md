# The Discord SFZ General MIDI Bank
**Work in progress**
A free opensource General MIDI soundbank in native SFZ format.
All details and documentation can be found here :  [Wiki](https://github.com/sfzinstruments/Discord-SFZ-GM-Bank/wiki).

## Purpose
At this moment, there is no dedicated free GM bank in SFZ format to quickly play MIDi files that are available on the internet.
This  project is to create a decent SFZ GM bank using available free/opensource samples, and samples provided by contributors.
The finished product will be shared freely, including commercial use.

## Want to help?
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/sfzinstruments/Discord-SFZ-GM-Bank/wiki) and [Conventions](https://github.com/sfzinstruments/Discord-SFZ-GM-Bank/wiki/Conventions).

## Target engines
- Plogue sforzando
- SFZTools sfizz
- Un4seen BASSMIDI

## Sampleset size
The limit size for the bank is not yet decided as it will depend on what we can find. The target audio quality is 16-bit 44.1 kHz Wav.
Currently, wav, aiff, and flac formats are used.  Eventually we hope to provide separate single-format sets for wav and flac.
The idea is to keep the size at low as possible for fast loading with minimal memory consumption, which is important for GM sound banks.

## Sources
The sources of the samples may expand along this project goes on.
Here are some of the sources that are used or considered for use:
- Versilian Studios VCSL
- Versilian Studios VSCO CE
- Salamander Grand Piano
- freesound.org
- MSLP Samples

## Licenses
- Each instrument is licensed by its creator
- The creator's license terms can be found in the .sfz file for the instrument.
- Only CC0, CC-BY, and equivalent licences are allowed.  (I will expand this list to specify equivalent licenses.)
- More restrictive licenses are not allowed.  For example, we plan for this to be usable in products, so CC-NC is not permitted.
- Eventually a single license list will be provided as a text file, which can be used by anyone repackaging a GM sfz.
